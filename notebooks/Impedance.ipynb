    "In order to get a better understanding of impedance, we can define two boundaries: $Z_a$ and $Z_b$. We will use these to define the impedances of the first boundary, where our wave will be coming from ($Z_a$), and $Z_b$ as the impedance of the second boundary, where our wave is travelling to. We know that our wave has an amplitude that it is travelling with - let us denote it as $A_i$ (for incoming amplitude). We also know that our wave will either get reflected or transmitted - and we can denote those amplitudes as $A_r$ and $A_t$ respectively. The reason why we are interested in defining these amplitudes is because amplitudes are directly related to the energy transported by the wave (recall that intensity is proportional with square of amplitude, $I \\propto A^2 $, and intensity is simply energy per unit area per unit time). Using this information, we can define \n",

    "In order to understand how we came about these derivations, we need to consider conservation of energy and apply it to amplitudes of the wave (incoming, reflected and transmitted). To make this easier to understand, we can represent the same coefficients using electromagnetic (EM) waves, where we denote the amplitude of the incoming EM wave as $E_i$, amplitude of the reflected wave as $E_r$ and transmitted as $E_t$. We can also use the well known refractive indices of different media denoted as $n_1$ and $n_2$ that are analagous to $Z_a$ and $Z_b$. Thus, we arrive at very similar equations relating amplitudes of the incoming, reflected and transmitted EM wave and refractive indices of media that it propagates through:\n",

The waves that are firstly send through tissue go through series of reflection and transmission, and are then picked up again to create an imagine of the organ that is of interest."
