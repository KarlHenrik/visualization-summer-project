    "Let us now apply everything that we have learnt so far to understand how ultrasound imaging is used in prenatal care. When an ultrasound pulse travels through the body on its way to the fetus, it has to propagate through multiple surfaces, which have different impedance values. For example, once the sound has travelled through skin (its very first barrier), it will be travelling towards the uterine wall. Once it hits the uterine wall, the signal will keep propagating through the amniotic fluid (fluid surrounding the fetus inside of the uterus), potentially also the placenta, and finally, end up reaching the fetus. But how exactly do we end up getting a clear image of the foster without it being ruined by reflections between the uterine wall and the amniotic fluid? This is an interesting problem since we know that we will be getting as much reflection between the uterine wall and amniotic fluid as we would from the amniotic fluid and the fetus. But why exactly does this not interfere with the image that we get at the end of the procedure?"

That way, most of the way is able to propagate through further into the uterine wall and at the end, all the way to the fetus. "

We see that illustrated when we observe the reflected fraction of the wave pulse coming back to initial position. We also recall the fact that the wave pulses are being sent after each other with a specific time frame - this time frame is used to wait for the previous reflected wave pulse to return back to the transducer.  \n",

We did not illustrate the behaviour of the wave packet as it moves deeper into the body, but since we know that the impedance difference betweem those different tissues is so similar, roughly the same amnount of waves will be reflected back to the trasducer from each boundary. We have also simplified the animation and did not illustrate how the reflected waves would get affected by the skin and uterine wall boundaries on their way back to the tranducer - in theory, they would have lost some energy and their amplitudes would have decreased a little bit as well.\n",

    "The answers to the question above lies in the fact that wave pulses travel different distances on their way from the transducer down to the fetus - and even though each wave pulse gets reflected equally from each boundary, they do not interfere with each other on their way back to the transducer as they arrive there at different times. This time is crucial to us - it is being used to calculate how far down the pulse travelled (recall the speed, distance and time relationship), which is then used to create a more dimensional image which shows the depth of each boundary that is being examined. This is possible, as we recall, since we assume the speed of sound to be roughly the same though most tissues in the body (excluding some, such as bones for example). "

    "Some of the things that we have not discussed here is attenuation - we have explained how the amplitude of ultrasound wave pulses passing through tissue changes in terms of impedance differences, however, there are other factors that affect it. Attenuation refers to phenomenon that describes how intensity and amplitude of those waves (or wave pulses) changes, while also considering scattering and absorption. For example, one could look into the relationship between absorption of different tissues and attenuation coefficient  - and compare the transmitted pulse to the original pulse after this absorption. Read more about it here [5]!\n",

One of the things that can be explored is the width of the transducer and its relation to the resolution of those wave pulses once sent and received back from the body, specifically in terms of the wave pulses' frequency. Get inspired by reading more about it here [6]!  \n",
