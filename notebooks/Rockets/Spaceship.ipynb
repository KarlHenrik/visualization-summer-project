The latter is the point in which the spaceship is closest to the planet during its orbit, and likewise the furthest point away from the planet is called the apoasis. In agreement with Kepler' second law, the orbit speed in inversly proportional with the distance between the spaceship and the planet, thus during the orbit, the spaceship obtains its max velocity near the periapsis, and its minimum near the apoasis.

These relations and definitions is the basis of the Oberth effect, which states that an implusive burn of the propelant, providing an equal increament in the rocket's velocity regardless of position, has the most efficient gain on the mechanical energy near the periapsis, and least efficent at the apoasis. Firstly, this can be explained by considering the kinetic energy of the spaceship at point A and P. Lets say that the propelent accelerate the spaceship with an increament $\\delta v$, then the effect on the kinetic energy would be: \n",
