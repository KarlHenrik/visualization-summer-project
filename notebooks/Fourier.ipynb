    "## What is a Fourier series\n",
    "Fourier series was devolped by Joseph Fourier in the early 1800's as a way of simplyfing differential equations. A Fourier seris in general is a method of transforming a periodic function into a sum of sine and cosine functions. A similar methods for non-periodic functions exists and is called a Fourier transform. One of the main motivations for Fourier series and transformations is the fact that these simple trigonometric functions are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, which is a very familiar identity in many physical problems. The sum of trigonometric functions can be expressed as bellow. \n",
