    "In this \"book\" we will explore some central concepts within the field of materials science, and as well attempt to apply properties of mathematics such as vectors and trognometry to derive complex physical models and laws. Notably we will make use of animation to illusrtrate the concept of wave superposition and finaly Bragg's law of diffraction, which is a specific example of the Laue condition.   "

    "## Materials science\n",
    "To begin with, lets take a look at two terms that pretty much lay the foundation of which most of modern materials science is built on, namley the crystal cell (or supercell) and its corresponding unit cell. (Shown in figure 1)  \n",

    "This representation of material structures treats atomic ordering as an infinite periodic arrays of discrete points, and is known as a Bravais lattice. In 3D, there are 14 induvidual classes, one of which is the \"primitive cell\", shown above. One common feature of these cells is that they are made up of three angles $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, and three unit axes $a, b, c$. In the simplest case, the cubic unit cell, a = b = c, and $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 90^\\circ$. But this is not nescaccarly the case for other structures, such as a hexagonal or triclinic bravais lattices (See additional reading). \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key concepts of the Bravais lattice are the lattice points. A lattice point can in theory represent an atom, or a molecule, but given the symmetry of the supercell, an induvidual lattice will only equal a fraction of said atom/molecule becaouse the same point is shared between neigboring cells (See figure 1 and study the amount of cells that share one point). For example, a corner point in a bravais lattice is shared by eight cells, therefore a corner latice point is equal to 1/8 atom/molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another neat feature of a Bravais lattice is that every point in the lattice can be described by the sum of the three unit axes a,b,c and three integers. If we let the vector $\\vec{R}$ describe the vector from the unit cell origio, to a given point, then each lattice point can be described by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{R} = u\\vec{a} + v\\vec{b} + w\\vec{c} \n",
    "$$ , where u, v, and w are integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, some of the lattice points in the example structure in figure 1 is located at [1a,0b,0c], [0a,1b,0c] and [0a,0b,1c].\n",
    "\n",
    "> Descibe the remaining lattice points in figure 1b in the similar manner.\n",
