    "This representation of crystal structures treats atomic ordering as an infinite periodic arrays of discrete points, and is known as a **Bravais lattice**. In 3D, there are 14 induvidual classes, one of which is the \"primitive cell\", shown above(right). Common for all unit cells is that they represent the smallest possible ordering to capture the perodicity of the larger supercell, and hence is made up of three angles $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, and three unit axes $a, b, c$, poiting to various spheres called **lattice points**. In cubic unit cells, for instance a face centered cubic lattice (figure 2), a = b = c, and $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 90^\\circ$. But this is not nescaccarly the case for other structures, such as a hexagonal or triclinic bravais lattices.\n",

    "From figure 1 we can see that every lattice point can be described by the unit axes a, b, c. For instance the corner points in the bottom plane in the unit cell is located at: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", if $\\vec{r}$ is a vector pointing from origo (0,0,0) to the lattice point. In general we say that each lattice point in the supercell can be desribed by integers u, v, w and the unit axes a,b, c as $\\vec{r} = u\\cdot \\vec{a} + v\\cdot \\vec{b} + w\\cdot \\vec{c}$. \n",
    "This term lattice point can in theory represent an atom, but it can also represent a collection of atoms or a molecule. One feature to make note of is that beacouse of the symmetry of the supercell, every induvidual lattice point will only equal a fraction of said atom/molecule as the same point is shared between neigboring cells (See figure 1 and study the amount of cells that share one point). For example, a corner point in a bravais lattice is shared by eight cells, therefore a corner latice point is equal to 1/8 atom/molecule.\n",

    "The planes of atom in a lattice is commonnly reffered to as **crystal planes** or hkl planes due to their particular notation {hkl}. For instance, in figure 2 we note that the top plane is denoted {001} as it cuts the c axis, and is parallel to the a, and b direction. A very important parameter related to the idea of crystal planes is the quantity plane distance (or seperation), and it represent the distance from a plane to the next identical plane. In this example, as the next plane of atoms equal to the top plane, is the bottom plane. The plane distance is equal to the size of the c-axis.\n",

Waves being a linear system, satisfy the superposition principle that in short expalins the form of an addidative wave from two initial waves that traverese thes same space. The resultant wave is formed by the the sum of the amplitudes from the intial waves. This can result in whats known as either constructive or destructive interference. \n",

    "Bragg's law is a widley applied law in physics that is used to examine various crystallographic properties. Some of the various instrumentations and appliences of Bragg's law will be discussed briefly at the end. However the instrumentation, the central working method is Bragg's law. When two in-phase waves strike crystallographic planes seperated by a distance d, the Bragg condition states the relation between the incident and outgoing waves for the scattered rays to remain in-phase, thus creating constructive interference. The defintion is:\n",

    "\n",

You should try increasing/decreasing the incident angle by pressing the arrow keys, and also alter the plane seperation d through the slider. And it should be apperant when the condition yields constructive and destructive interference. \n",

    "With the aid of figure 3, it can be shown that Bragg's law come to fruition simply from trigonometric considerations. Remembering the the phase-relation for constructive vs destructive interference, ie $\\pi /2$ promotes completly destructive interference, but $n\\cdot \\pi$ yileds constructive interference. Also remembering the goal of Bragg's law, namely that the scattering of two in-phase rays produce also two in-phase outgoing waves. If we then consider the incident and scattered ray to note the path of one wave , we find that the Bragg's law is satisfied when the path of one wave is an integer times the wavelength of the first wave.

    "## Application\n",
    "Why are we at all interested in Bragg's law? Despite the fun trigonomety and vector excercies of course! Well, it just so happens that its an extremly important law of physics that is applied to study materials. The most common methods of examining materials today via spectroscopy is through methods such as X-ray diffraction or electron spectrocopy. And yes you guessed it, both of those rely heavily on Bragg diffraction. Lets first take a look at XRD and its use. In an XRD instrument, a sample, traditionally of powder, is being examined by monochromatic X-ray beams, most comonly $\\kappa \\alpha_1$ of either Cu or Mg. The main concept of this instrumentation is the rotation of the sample, when rotating the sample, according to Bragg's law certain crystal planes gives rise to constructive interference that is registred at the sensor, along the value of $\\theta$. From this, one can consruct and X-ray diffractogram of the sample as the one shown for Si bellow (Figure 4). From this one can relate the different values of $\\theta$ and intensites throguh bragg's law to obtain information about the crystal structure of the sample. There is also possibilty to do qualitative and quantative analyisis of the sample from data in the diffractogram.     \n",

Bellow is typpical TEM diffraction images of a single crystal and a polycrystaline specimen called SAD, or selected area diffraction images. The feature to take note of here is that a single crystal shows diffraction spots, while a polycrystal displays diffraction rings. In the single crystal, the spots each represent a crystal plane, while the rings each represent a set of planes with equal plane spacing. \n",
