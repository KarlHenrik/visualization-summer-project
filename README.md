# visualization-summer-project

A repository for visualizations of various scientific topics with the purpose of helping students understand and engage with the material. The visualizations, explanations and exercises are written in javascipt, python and jupyter notebooks, and are put together into a website with Jupyter Book.

## The folders

`_static` contains the javascipt and css which goes into the generated website.

`notebooks` contains the jupyter notebooks which act as the different pages of the website.

`docs` contains the generated website files from Jupyter Book which GitHub Pages uses to build the website.

## The files

`config.yml`, `_toc.yml` and `build_docs.sh` are all used to modify and build the website.
